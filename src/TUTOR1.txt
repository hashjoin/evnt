        --------------------
        What's next:
           o configure hosts/sids that will be monitored by EVNT
           o make sure to change EVNT account's password
           o startup EVNT processes issue:

                % cd /u01/app/oracle/admin/scripts/mon/sys/bin
                % startup.sh local bgproc/justagate@tutor

2. LOGIN TO MANAGEMENT WEBSITE

http://thost.dbatoolz.com:7777/pls/EVNT/web_nav_pkg.evnt
        username:       webproc
        password:       welcome

"Event Module: At A Glance" screen should be displayed



3. CREATE "Tablespace Usage" EVENT ASSIGNMENT

Click on "Assigments" on the NAV bar

Table with all available hosts should be displayed.  These hosts are added using 
"$SYS_TOP/bin/addsid.sh" script or if host does not have a SID using 
"$SYS_TOP/bin/trgint.sh" script with "$SYS_TOP/bin/SERVER.dat" datafile see FAQ 
section [3.4 HOW TO REGISTER STAND ALONE HOST(S)?] in the following document: 
   http://kb.dbatoolz.com/ex/uploads/4389.EVNT.txt 

Click "Create" button next to any host

Enter/Select the following:

Sid:            <pick_your_SID>
Click "Next"

Sid Cred.:      mon@<your_sid>
Click "Next"

Event:          TABSP_USAGE - tabsppct.sh (Tablespace Usage)
Click "Next"

Threshold:      TBSP_80PCT (tablespace usage > 80%)
Click "Next"

Page List:      EMAIL
Click "Next"

Interval(MIN):          30              (run event every 30 minutes)
Keep History(DAY):      -1              (keep history indefinitely)
Status:                 Active
Start Time:             <sysdate>       (next event check will run at this time)
Click "Create"

"Event System - Control Panel" screen should show up with all even assignments 
registered to the host you used in the previous step.  The row will be colored 
"red" due to "behind schedule" status of the new assignment, if your background 
process (bgproc) was started on the management server it should process this new 
assignment next times it runs.


4. CONTROLLING BACKGROUND PROCESSES

You can check background processes status on the management server by using the 
following script:

   % cd $SYS_TOP/bin/
   % bstat


thost.TUTOR-> cd $SYS_TOP/bin/
thost.TUTOR-> bstat
Content-type: text/plain

-----------------------------------------
 Date:      Wed Jul 16 15:40:46 PDT 2003
 Hostname:  thost
-----------------------------------------

Current number of active processes:  0

thost.TUTOR->


As you see the background processes are not active, lets start them up:
   % startup.sh local bgproc/justagate@<MGM_TNS_ALIAS>
   WHERE:
      local
        tells BGPROC that this is the management server not remote host
      
      <MGM_TNS_ALIAS>
        TNS alias to the database that hosts EVNT's repository
      
thost.TUTOR-> startup.sh local bgproc/justagate@TUTOR
startup:        in /u01/app/oracle/admin/scripts/mon/sys/bin ...

  oracle 10405 10400  1 15:42:04 pts/4    0:00 sqlplus -s bgproc/justagate@TUTOR


Lets check for the status now:

thost.TUTOR-> bstat
Content-type: text/plain

-----------------------------------------
 Date:      Wed Jul 16 15:42:52 PDT 2003
 Hostname:  thost
-----------------------------------------

Current number of active processes:  3

  oracle 10376     1  1 15:42:03 pts/4    0:00 /bin/ksh ./bgman.sh EVNT evntlistl.sh 5
  oracle 10377     1  0 15:42:04 pts/4    0:00 /bin/ksh ./mailbg.sh
  oracle 10375     1  0 15:42:03 pts/4    0:00 /bin/ksh ./bgman.sh COLL colllist.sh 30

Event [EVNT] and collection [COLL] background processes are active waiting for 
work to process; mailbg.sh is the background mail system.


5. CHECKING EVENT ASSIGNMENT STATUS
  
Things are running, lets go check what happened to the event assignment we just 
created ... It's still colored "red"!  What just happened?  Take a look at the 
"STS" column ... it has letter "B" in there which means that the assignment is 
broken.  Now go check your "sysadmin" email that you setup in MON.env file, you 
should have the following email message there:


SUBJECT: ERROR_running_EVNT(thost): 1

ERROR:   While executing event file: 
/u01/app/oracle/admin/scripts/mon/evnt/seed/bin/tabsppct.sh !

Our assignment errored out due to "ORA-12154: TNS:could not resolve service 
name" that's expected since we haven't configured our target database's TNS 
alias on the management server (well at least I haven't yet ...).

Lets fix this.  Go to the management server and make sure MON.env is sourced:
   % cd $TNS_ADMIN
   % vi tnsnames.ora
Now add the TNS alias for the database that was used in step #3.

Check by using tnsping (my TNS alias is RDATA you will have something else):
thost.TUTOR-> tnsping RDATA

TNS Ping Utility for Solaris: Version 8.1.7.4.0 - Production on 16-JUL-2003 15:59:25

Attempting to contact (ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=rhost)(PORT=1521))
OK (20 msec)

Ok, things look better now, lets see if event assignment will complete now ... 
You can either wait until BGPROC will process it or you can speed it up a bit by 
changing the "Start Time" of the assignment:

Click on the "Edit" link of the event assignment on the "Control Panel" screen.
Change the following:
Status:         from "Broken" to "Active"
Start Time:     <sysdate>
Click "Update"

The system will take you back to the Control Panel screen, click refresh button 
few times ... the row should become "normal" "active" color and the event will 
either have triggered or just didn't find and problems with your tablespaces. In 
my case it triggered so I will check what's up with my tablespaces.  


6. EVENT ASSIGNMENT TRIGGER NAVIGATOR

Before we go further I'll explain few columns on this screen:

Column Name     Description
--------------  ----------------------
Control Links   self explanatory
Id              assignment's ID
Target          target host (and optionally sid)
PND             number of pending triggers
OLD             number of old triggers (old triggers are the triggers that were 
                created between the first and the last time event was triggered)
CLR             number of cleared triggers
Threshold       event's threshold
Page List       self explanatory
STS             status (A=Active, B=Broken, I=Inactive)
INT(M)          interval in minutes
Scheduled       time the event is scheduled to run at
Finished        time the event finished last time it ran
RT(S)           last known elapsed runtime time in seconds
RMT             agent type (YES=Remote, NO=Local)

Easy right?  Now on to the trigger screen ...

Click "1" in the PND column (again this is assuming your tablespaces had issues 
that were discovered by the event trigger)

You should now see "Pending Triggers" screen with the following columns:
Column                  Description
---------------------   --------------------
Target                  target host (and optionally sid)
Time                    trigger time
Status                  name of the threshold that triggered the event
TID                     THIS     trigger ID (trigger ID)
OID                     ORIGINAL trigger ID (trigger ID that started it all)
CID                     CLEARED  trigger ID (trigger ID that cleared it all or 
                        blank if event is not cleared)
PID                     PREVIOUS trigger ID (previous trigger ID in the chain)
Acknowledgement         either admin NAME who acknowledged THIS trigger or "Not Required"
NOTIF                   number of notifications that were send out for THIS trigger
NOTES                   either number of notes for THIS trigger or "Add" link
P                       Phase status (P=Pending, C=Closed, O=Old)
M                       Mail status (P=Pending, C=Complete)

Click on the "trigger id" link in the "TID" column.

"Trigger Navigator" screen should appear:
Column          Description
--------------- -----------------
|<< STR         rewind to the first trigger
<< REW          rewind to the previous trigger
CUR             current trigger ID
FRW >>          forward to the next trigger
END >>|         forward to the last trigger
Target          target host (and optionally sid) 
Trigger Time    trigger time 
Status          name of the threshold that triggered the event 
Description     description of the threshold that triggered the event
Acknowledgement either admin NAME who acknowledged THIS trigger or "NOT REQUIRED" 
Notifications   number of notifications that were send out for THIS trigger 
Notes           either number of notes for THIS trigger or "Add" link 

"Compare <THIS trigger id> with" button allows comparison of THIS trigger's 
attributes with any previous or following triggers (if present).

"[ALL VALUES]" table displays THIS trigger's attributes.

"Trigger Output" table displays THIS triggers's output.

That's it, pretty simple so far.


7. EVENT TRIGGERS ANALYSIS TOOLS

Lets review what ways we have to slice and dice our event triggers.

Look at the navigator bar on your left:
"Pending Events" - displays all pending event triggers.
"Today's Events" - allows daily navigation and detailed event trigger analysis 
                   by target.
"Weekly Trends"  - allows weekly navigation and daily analysis by event.
"Thresholds"     - then click "TABSP_USAGE" event in "Control Links" column 
                   "triggers" link displays all triggers generated by this event 
                   threshold across all targets.
"Trigger Lookup" - single trigger lookup by ID takes you directly to trigger 
                   navigator screen.
"Monthly Trends" - allows yearly navigation and monthly analysis by event. 
                   Even if triggers are purged this module will still give you 
                   counts and details but without drilldown capability for 
                   purged triggers.

8. REPORTS

There are two types of reports available with EVNT system:
   1) repository based reports that run off of data collected by events.
   2) remote/db link based reports that go directly to the target database for 
      up-to-date information.

Just navigate through the following links - it's self explanatory:
"Reports (Repository)"
"Reports (DB Links)"
